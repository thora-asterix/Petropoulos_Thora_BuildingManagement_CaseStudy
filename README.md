What is the Building Management System?

This application aims to help a building superintendent to keep track of everyday tasks and issues of apartment rentals
It maintains a list of various service companies that serve the building and the individual apartments
The superintendent  of the building can create tasks related to the building maintenance and assign service companies to complete the tasks
The superintendent can also create issues that are related to the individual apartments
The apartments can be occupied by tenants or be vacant
Vacant apartments have a public API  that serves JSON that can be consumed by the other applications

Technologies Used:

For the back-end of the application the following technologies were used:
- MariaDB as the Database 
- Spring Boot, with Spring JPA Data, and Spring Web as the back-end framework, along with Spring Security

For the front-end  of the application the following technologies were used:
-  Thymeleaf templates were used, along with Bootstrap, CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript
 - A small React app was also created as front-end technology that consumes the public API of vacant apartments (This is a small side project to practice using other front-end technologies besides Thymeleaf templates.  It was completed with React, Bootstrap and the AXIOS library
